# Space Invaders

This is my coursework of C++ Programming module.

It's a 2D retro game based on SDL2 library, with some powerful features:

- Advanced collision detection: Using Separating Axis Theorem, the back-end monitor can detect collisions between two simple polygons, or between a polygon and a circle. 
- Smart object handler: the handler constantly create and destroy various dynamic objects with no memory leak.
- Full pause facility: all moving objects stay stationary and then carry on normally (from where they paused) when the program is unpaused without errors and memory leak.
